## Professional life

Creating and designing experiences that make people's lives easier. Full-stack developer who is passionate about making websites and web stores better, faster, and easier to update.

I've crafted hundreds of websites and services for clients in Finland and globally, built my own sports and eCommerce platforms, and implemented various REST APIs using Node and PHP. Also very crafty with frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and SvelteKit. Always eager to take on new challenges.

The emphasis is on simplicity, speed, usability, ease of updating, and delight. My ambition is to outperform both myself and my customers. I consider myself successful when the customer feels they have received more than they originally ordered.
