## Professional life

Creating and designing experiences that make people's lives easier. Full-stack web developer who is passionate about making websites and web stores better, faster, and easier to update.

Since starting my entrepreneurial journey over seven years ago, I've developed hundreds of customer projects, including booking calendars for stables and events, and built my own e-commerce and sports platform. I have also made several interface solutions, including payment interfaces and REST APIs. Always eager to take on new challenges.

JavaScript, TypeScript, SvelteKit, React, Nuxt, Vue, PHP, Node.js, and MariaDB are among the technologies I enjoy working with. ProcessWire and WordPress are frequently used as client admin areas and backends.

The emphasis is on simplicity, speed, usability, ease of updating, and delight. My ambition is to outperform both myself and my customers. I consider myself successful when the customer feels they have received more than they originally ordered.
